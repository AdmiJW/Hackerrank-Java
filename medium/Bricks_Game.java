/*
 * 	This is a DP problem, but a little hard to find out the pattern.
 * 	The subproblem is the same as the base problem, to find out the maximum score that we can get, but need further details.
 * 	If we have a brick stack, and the problem stated that we will be always be the starting person. That means we are compulsory to take
 * 	at least 1 brick from the stack. Perhaps take 2, or 3
 * 
 * 	Let an example brick stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (where 1 is top of stack, 5 is bottom)
 * 
 * 	To exploit this property from bottom up approach, we have to see the brick stack from bottom to top, starting from only the lowest brick
 * 	and move our way to the top.
 * 	Therefore, the first question will be: What is maximum score that we get if the brick stack is [5], then subsequently [4, 5], [3, 4, 5]...
 * 
 * 	If we are the player, if the stack is only 3 size high, then of course we're gonna take it all. (Initialization).
 * 
 *  However, if the brick size are larger, then we have to think of a way to maximize the scoring, also considering the enemy player's optimal
 * 	move! <<< (The harder part to realize)
 * 
 * 	For each subproblem (The starting brick, bottom-up), we can find out the solution by considering the moves:
 * 		-Taking 1 brick, which is the top
 * 		-Taking 2 of them
 * 		-Taking 3 of them
 *  AND we need to think the consequences of each action.
 *  
 *  Assuming we are at brick N and we know all the solutions for all the brick below it. The solution here means we've calculated maximum
 *  score to be obtained for each moves, and recorded the best move to take (either take 1, 2 or 3).
 *  What will happen if i take 1, 2 or 3? The thing that will happen is:
 *  	-The enemy will start at N - T brick, where T is the number of brick that you took. The enemy being as smart as you are, will know the
 *  	 optimum action to take, either taking 1,2 or 3 brick. Then you will have your turn again at N - T - ET brick, where ET is the 
 *  	 number of bricks enemy had taken.
 *  
 *  With above situation in consideration, you are now able to calculate the maximum score that you'll get for each move!
 *  In each move, you know which brick enemy will start with, and you will predict how many bricks that enemy will take, then
 *  you will know which brick you'll land on again, which again, contains its own maximum score data!!!
 *  
 *  Therefore, each action's score is just (scores of brick you take this turn) + (maximum score of brick you land on again)
 *  From the 3 action scores, find the maximum of the 3, record it, and goes one level higher, until you've reached back at the original
 * 	problem.
 * 
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Again, we can further compress the problem to be more easier.
 * 	For each brick, we're going to know how many brick the enemy is going to take and how much he is going to score. Therefore,
 * 	we would just create an array of cumulative sum table (Summing up the brick scores subsequently), and for each brick,
 * 	we will take the current cumulative sum of the brick, minus the enemy's maximum score. That will be our score if we made that action.
